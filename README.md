## 🧠 About Me

Over the past 20 years, I've:
- Created roadmaps that made engineers smile *and* made finance nod in approval
- Built internal developer platforms used by thousands of engineers—without breaking production on a Friday
- Led infrastructure and platform strategy across Fortune 5 and 49 orgs (yes, I’ve seen it all)
- Scaled high-performance compute environments for global R&D teams before “cloud” was more than weather
- Orchestrated infrastructure and security programs that kept mergers on track and auditors calm (simultaneously—no small feat)
- Migrated data centers, applications, and entire business units without losing a single packet or stakeholder’s patience
- Managed global HPC and infrastructure modernization projects before “cloud” became a strategy deck staple
- Delivered cross-functional programs where success meant uptime, compliance, and occasionally, surviving budget season

I specialize in:
- Developer platforms & internal tooling as products  
- Infrastructure strategy (on-prem, hybrid, cloudy with a chance of resilience)  
- Technical storytelling with just enough slides to get funding  
- Leading teams through architectural ambiguity, cultural shifts, and undocumented systems
- Infrastructure & Security Program Management – orchestrating complex initiatives that bridge architecture, governance, and execution
- M&A & Data Center Transitions – coordinating people, process, and platforms through the chaos of consolidation
- Technical Storytelling & Stakeholder Alignment – translating engineering complexity into boardroom clarity—with minimal slides and maximum impact
- Global High-Performance Compute Delivery – aligning R&D, finance, and operations for environments that push limits (but not SLAs)

## 📎 Philosophy (aka Things I Believe)

Programs should:
-  **align**, not **collide**
-  **steer** the ship, not **rearrange** deck chairs
-  *Plans are **maps**, not **mandates***
-  **enable** momentum, not **meetings**
-  **connect** the dots, not **collect** them
-  **orchestrate** outcomes, not **overhead**
-  *Program management is where optimism meets Gantt charts*

Platforms should:
- **empower**, not **enforce**
- **build** bridges, not **barriers**
- **enable** velocity, not **vanity**
- **guide**, not **gatekeep**
- *Make the right thing, the easy thing*
- *Frictionless by design, trusted by default*
- Technical debt isn’t bad—*as long as you’re charging interest*
- “It depends” is an acceptable answer — *if followed by a diagram & Gannt chart*
- *Leadership is less about answers and more about unblocking smart people*

### 🧯 Bonus Trivia
- I've migrated data centers, teams, and platforms—and only cried once  
- I document like I wish others would  
- Favorite outage fix: Turning it off and back on *strategically*
