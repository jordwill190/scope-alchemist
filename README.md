## 🧠 About Me

Over the past 26 years, I've:
- Created roadmaps that made engineers smile *and* made finance nod in approval
- Built internal developer platforms used by thousands of engineers—without breaking production on a Friday
- Led infrastructure and platform strategy across Fortune 5 and 49 orgs (yes, I’ve seen it all)
- Scaled high-performance compute environments for global R&D teams before “cloud” was more than weather

I specialize in:
- Developer platforms & internal tooling as products  
- Infrastructure strategy (on-prem, hybrid, cloudy with a chance of resilience)  
- Technical storytelling with just enough slides to get funding  
- Leading teams through architectural ambiguity, cultural shifts, and undocumented systems

## 📎 Philosophy (aka Things I Believe)

- Platforms should **empower**, not **enforce**
- Technical debt isn’t bad—*as long as you’re charging interest*
- “It depends” is an acceptable answer—if followed by a diagram
- Leadership is less about answers and more about unblocking smart people
