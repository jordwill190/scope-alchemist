# Optum Technology

## Director / Principal Tech Program & Product Portfolio Manager 		(2019-Present)
- **Healthcare Platform** (*Portfolio Manager*): In early 2025, I was promoted to portfolio owner for our Optum HCP (Healthcare Platform) Engineering Platform. As the portfolio owner for the HCP Engineering Platform, my mission is to empower engineers to efficiently create high-quality healthcare applications. The platform serves as a centralized hub, offering effortless access to reusable components, collaborative tools, and best practices, which streamlines development and encourages cross-team innovation. Its value lies in expediting development cycles, improving consistency and quality, and enabling engineers to concentrate on delivering impactful healthcare solutions that advance progress within the broader healthcare ecosystem.
 
- **Public Cloud Account Manager, Disposable Cloud Environment, Service Based Launchpad** (*Product Manager*): Building on these accomplishments, I oversaw the delivery of public cloud products, achieving rapid deployment of essential compliance and security measures, all while meeting challenging deadlines and cultivating strong stakeholder relationships.

- **Optum Digital Infrastructure** (*Platform Manager*): I took on the role of platform owner for Optum Digital Infrastructure where I led the development of a developer-focused, cloud-like environment. This project enabled seamless self-service, effective capacity management, and provided scalable, secure solutions through strategic collaboration and customer engagement. 
  
- **Metal As A Service** (*Product Manager*): Demonstrating a strategic approach to leadership, I directed teams of architects to promote Agile adoption and establish best practices across our Advanced Engineering and Emerging Tech teams. 
Transitioning to a "new" Product Management role, I championed an automation initiative, which drastically reduced physical server build times from weeks to under an hour. This platform became especially crucial in supporting healthcare clients during the Covid crisis, highlighting my dedication to delivering significant, efficient, and innovative solutions.

# Motorola Inc

## Principal Systems Engineer (early years)
- My Enterprise journey began with launching High Performance Compute solutions for Motorola’s Global Engineering Centers of Excellence, revolutionizing complex analysis and prototype modeling—from chemical, acoustical, and physical to fluid mechanics—so that tasks once requiring months could be accomplished in hours, while physical prototype expenses dropped from multi-millions to less than 25k per simulation iteration.
